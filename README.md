# Music_Store_Analysis-using-SQL
# Project Description
This project involves analyzing a music store's database using SQL and Excel to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management. By writing and executing SQL queries, we extract, transform, and analyze data from various tables, including customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and genres. Additionally, Excel is used to manage and manipulate the initial CSV data. The analysis aims to answer key business questions such as top-selling tracks, popular genres, customer demographics, and sales trends. The insights gained from this analysis can help the music store improve its marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.
